1
Which registers contain arguments to functions? 
For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
call.asm中地址0x24的指令将13放在了a2

2
Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? 
Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
已经被编译器优化，可以在编译期计算除结果，没有显示的调用。

3
At what address is the function printf located?
0x640

4
What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
30，因为jalr 1552(ra)，ra+1552 = 0x640，1552 = 0x610，所以ra = 30

5
Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);

6     
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. 
If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what 
would you set i to in order to yield the same output?
 Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
打印的是He110 World。如果RISC-V是小端系统，那么i理论上应该是0x726c6400，57616不变

7
In the following code, what is going to be
 printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.)
  Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
	
寄存器a2的值是多少就打印多少。
